# Task Manager CLI Application in Java

I developed a console-based Task Manager application in Java using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture to provide an efficient and organized way to manage tasks. This project allows users to easily add, list, update, and delete tasks, with data stored persistently using a file-based approach, ensuring that tasks remain intact across sessions.

## Key Features:
- **Task CRUD Operations** â€“ Add, list, update, and delete tasks to maintain a dynamic to-do list.
- **File-Based Persistence** â€“ Leverages the DAO-Factory pattern to store tasks, ensuring seamless interaction with data.
- **Logging Mechanism** â€“ Integrated a comprehensive logging system for better tracking and debugging of task operations.
- **User-Friendly CLI** â€“ Provides a clean and intuitive interface for smooth task management, even for users with minimal technical knowledge.

## Technologies Used:
- Java (Core)
- OOP Principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism)
- Exception Handling
- File I/O
- Design Patterns (MVC, DAO-Factory)
- Logging (Java Util Logging)
