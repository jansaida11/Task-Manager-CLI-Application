# Task Manager CLI Application in Java

I developed a console-based Task Manager application in Java using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture to provide an efficient and organized way to manage tasks. This project allows users to easily add, list, update, and delete tasks, with data stored persistently using both a file-based approach and a relational database, ensuring flexibility and reliability.

## Key Features:
- **Task CRUD Operations** – Add, list, update, and delete tasks to maintain a dynamic to-do list.
- **Dual Persistence Mechanism** – Implemented a DAO layer that supports both file-based storage and a relational database for flexible data management.
- **Database-Backed DAO** – Designed a JDBC-powered DAO that interacts with a relational database (MySQL) for structured and reliable task storage.
- **Logging Mechanism** – Integrated a comprehensive logging system for better tracking and debugging of task operations.
- **User-Friendly CLI** – Provides a clean and intuitive interface for smooth task management, even for users with minimal technical knowledge.

## Technologies Used:
- Java (Core)
- OOP Principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism)
- Exception Handling
- File I/O
- JDBC (Database Connectivity)
- MySQL
- Design Patterns (MVC, DAO-Factory)
- Logging (Java Util Logging)
